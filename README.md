## Installation

To generate your README, `git clone` this repository to your local computer. Then run `npm install` in order to install the npm package dependencies.

## Usage

Run `node index.js` from the command line and answer the prompts to generate your README. Your README file will be named 'title'.md, where 'title' is the response you give to the corresponding question, the title of the project. The file will be written into the `dist` folder.

For any prompts that may require more than one line of text, a seperate editor is opened. You may enter your answers here, and when finished you may save and exit the editor by pressing:

1. Escape
2. : (colon)
3. wq (w = save, q = quit)
4. Enter
